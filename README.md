##Learning-shell

This is a shell I made to learn about the inner workings of a shell.
It only has **4** commands :

- [x] exit - To exit the shell.
- [x] cd   - To change directories.
- [x] pwd  - To print the current working directory.
- [x] ls   - To list contents in a directory.

> (No other functionaties are available other than running a file.)

The whole file is about 240 lines of code. So it really isn't flexible.(If it wasn't obvious)

The main goal was to learn to spawn processes and using the WIN32 API functions to do some work.
