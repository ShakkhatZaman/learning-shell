## Learning-shell

This is a shell I made to learn about the inner workings of a shell.

It only has **4** commands :

- [x] `exit` - To exit the shell.
- [x] `cd`   - To change directories.
- [x] `pwd`  - To print the current working directory path.
- [x] `ls`   - To list contents in a directory.

> (No other functionalities are available other than running a file.)

The whole file is about 240 lines of code. So it isn't flexible. (If it wasn't obvious)

The main goal was to learn to spawn processes and use the WIN32 API functions to do some work.

I used the **C** programming language with the `mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc` compiler and the windows header files that came with it.
